        The project was developed on a x86_64 PC running Ubuntu 20.04 through the WSL2 protocol. The specifications of the PC are as follows:\\
        \\
            - CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700X\\
            - RAM: 16GB DDR4\\
            - GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060 12GB\\
            \\
            The project was developed using Python 3.10.2 and the following libraries:\\
            \\
            - Tensorflow\\
            - Keras\\
            - Matplotlib\\
